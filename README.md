## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project contains data on content created on Social Buzz, focusing on user reactions.

## Analysis and Methods
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Performed data cleaning to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.
- Merged different datasets: reaction, content, and reaction type.

### Excel Analysis
- Created pivot tables and charts to summarize key insights.
